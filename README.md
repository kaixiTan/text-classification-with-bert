# text-classification-with-bert
# The main idea 
Revolves around text classification using various methods like fasttext, textcnn, or RNN-based approaches, but Bert stands out significantly in comparison for classification tasks. The official method involves taking the hidden representation of the [CLS] token through a fully connected layer for classification. 
To fully utilize the information at this time step, the last layer of Bert is extracted and subjected to operations such as global average pooling, global max pooling, and attention scores between [CLS] and other positions in the sequence for comprehensive representation. This integrated information is then fed into a fully connected 
layer for text classification. 
# The model training 
Employs five-fold cross-validation, dividing the training set into five parts, using one part as the validation set and the rest for training, resulting in five models. The final prediction on the test set is the average prediction of these five models.Due to the Bert model having a large number of parameters and the training set consisting
of only 16,000 entries, early stopping is employed to prevent overfitting. This approach allows the model to halt training when the validation metric stops improving, effectively avoiding the risk of the model learning the training data too closely and losing generalization ability.
